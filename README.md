Hello Everyone, Welcome to my selenium_Automation repository. </br>
Here you can see all the important Selenium concepts that I have covered as part of selenium practice with real examples, along with proper explanations. </br>
Please take a look at my Selenium programs and feel free to ask questions if you find it difficult to understand. </br>
I will add more advanced topics in the future, such as JavaScript executor, downloading files, Robot class, etc.... </br>
Stay tuned!!!!!!!!
